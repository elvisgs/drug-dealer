We desinged the  5HTP  dose to assist your master hormone gland, the pineal gland that makes Melatonin at night and Serotonin during the day. When these two hormones get out of balance, wee feel depressed during the day and cannot sleep well at night. A guaranteed formula for stress. Let our  5HTP  dose put things back in the norm. Best taken in the morning when you wake and/or at night before sleep,  5HTP  will re-level your hormones and help you feel happy again!"

And it works just like that: It starts with a low upramp of emotional feelings that seep into the deep crevices of your  brain , hardly there, with hardly any effect at all in the beginning. You feel something, that is for sure, as the dose begins to slowly work its way into your mind. A bit a bit of euphoria, that slight cold-sweat your body makes to warm you that something is happening. Not the strongest dose, so far. Not even all that great. Then, it hits! BOOOM! The A-BOMB goes off and the hrz level propels you into the deepest reaches of space where there is NO reality, which is why this dose is often called the reality buster. A-BOMB mixes everything we know about how binaural doses can effect you, and ramps it up times infinity. We get constant emails about this favorite, and they all say basically the same thing: IT BLEW MY MIND! Exactly."

We may never know for sure, since  Absinthe  was banned long ago. We've compared it to other real-world wormwood concoctions, and we think you will agree there is something to this: lucidity hits slowly as your speech becomes very articulate and your ideas clear, the haze sets, but but drifts, you are drunk but you aren't. Suddenly you realize why this was the drug of choice for Van Gogh, Baudelaire, and Verlaine - it is a surreal smooth unlike anything available on the street today that opens your mind, glosses over the universe, but makes everything clear all at once. Amazing, is what you will call it.  Absinthe  is what it is."

I wish we could easily put into words what this dose does, but it is so beyond words... let's try: It takes your  brain  and twists it so that everything shines with a beautiful glow, then it goes beyond and reverses all that glow deep inside you. There is no sunshine when you are looking face to face with your soul, and  Black Sunshine  puts you in a room with your soul and lets you two talk it out, but without talking. Communicating, with yourself, but so deep under you will strain to remember. Highly advanced, this dose attempts to bring you further under than any dose before it.

The psychoactivity of 5-MeO-DMT is clearly established and more data is coming to light which suggests that bufotenin is equally psychoactive (both smoked and oral) although somewhat less potent. While dried toad skins are sold by some vendors, there is little benefit to this method as toad venom can be collected without harming the toad 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine or N,N-dimethylserotonin.

Expect increased energy and  alert ness, decreased need for sleep, euphoria, increased sexuality, excessive talking, sweating, visual & auditory hallucinations (hearing voices.) This dose literally freaked out several of our  beta  testers when they got sweats and reported hearing things from inside their head. This dose can often feel somewhat more like MDMA (Ecstasy) than a simple stimulant including a sense of euphoria, openness, and intellectual expansion. There can be a mild psychedelic component as the new user feels they see the world a little differently. The sensation of mind-expansion and openness quickly fade after the first few uses and physical and mental stimulation dominate the experiential effects. Because of some of adverse effects like sweating and auditory hallucinations, we have marked this very strong. Use caution!"

Reports of pings of pain in your teeth (like drilling,) under your skin (feeling as if you were getting a tattoo,) and vice-grip like sensations on parts of your body are not uncommon... this pain, mixed with the euphoria and ecstasy, make this a very powerful, painful, sexual experience that is NOT intended for all users.
